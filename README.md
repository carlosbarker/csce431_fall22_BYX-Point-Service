# Google OAuth2 Environment Variables

Google OAuth2 uses two environment variables to work:

`GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`

`GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT-SECRET`

Setting these in a ".env" file *does not* work. Instead, you must pass these parameters when launching the Docker image:

`-e GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<ID> -e GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<SECRET>`

You can double check these variables have been passed successfully under the Inspect tab of the running container in Docker Desktop.

If deploying to Heroku, you must set these environment variables manually in the Heroku Dashboard or CLI.
Dashboard: app > Settings > Reveal Config Vars > Add

If you do not pass these variables when running locally, the app will run offline using a mock account and will not access Google servers. Note that the app *needs* these environment variables when running in production (i.e., running offline is not an option).

# Deployment

To deploy to Heroku:

* Create pull request in Github from new branch to merge to master
* Review app in Heroku automatically created for branch with pull request
* Check review app for functionality
* Approve pull request and merge to master
* Deployed production app automatically recreated with new master

# CI/CD

CI - Github Actions
CD - Heroku pipeline for automatic deployment for review apps and production apps
